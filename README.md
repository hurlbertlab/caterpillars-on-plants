## File Organization  
**`code` folder**  
* `plant_analysis_functions.r` - functions for calculating arthropod occurrence  
* `arthropods_on_plants.r` - complete analysis script  

**`data` folder**  
* `fullDataset_2025-04-18.csv` - Caterpillar's Count! foliage arthropod survey dataset  
* `officialPlantList2024-10-04.csv` - Table that converts user provided names (which could be a scientific name or different versions of a common name) into a standardized scientific name and ITIS id.  
* `inferredPlantNames_2024-08-20.csv` - For some survey branches where the site manager had not specified the plant species, we could infer the plant species from either the arthropod photos or consensus in user-provided names.  
* `plant_origin_status.csv` - Classification of a plant as native or alien in North America based on the USDA PLANTS Database.  
* `2025-06-17_ExpertIdentification.csv` - Taxonomic identifications of arthropod photos submitted with Caterpillars Count! surveys by users on iNaturalist.  
* `Table_S1.csv` - Supplemental Table S1, occurrence of 6 different arthropod groups on native versus alien plant species for each of 10 plant families.  
* `Table_S2.csv` - Supplemental Table S2, caterpillar occurrence and sample sizes on 100 native and alien plant species.

**`images` folder**  
* 6 arthropod icons used in figures
